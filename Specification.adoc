http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code[HMAC authentication] is based shared-secret cryptography where a signature is generated on the client side and validated by the server to authenticate the request.

This implementation is heavily influenced by the design of AWS and their http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html[Signing and Authenticating REST Requests] documentation.

WARNING: This specification has not yet been finalised. Do not rely on it for production systems.
